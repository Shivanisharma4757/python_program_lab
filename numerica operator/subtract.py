# Program to subtract two two-digit numbers

# Take first two-digit number as input
num1 = int(input("Enter the first two-digit number: "))

# Take second two-digit number as input
num2 = int(input("Enter the second two-digit number: "))

# Calculate the difference
difference = num1 - num2

# Display the result
print("The subtraction of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", difference)
