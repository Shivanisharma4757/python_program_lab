# Program to find common elements between two tuples

# Create two tuples
tuple1 = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
tuple2 = (30, 40, 60, 70)

# Convert tuples to sets and find intersection
common_elements = tuple(set(tuple1) & set(tuple2))

# Display results
print("Tuple 1:", tuple1)
print("Tuple 2:", tuple2)
print("Common elements:", common_elements)

# output
# Tuple 1: (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
# Tuple 2: (30, 40, 60, 70)
# Common elements: (40, 30)
